'''
    Create a Python program that converts kilograms to pounds. 
    Use at least four different samples to convert. 
    A sample of the math is provided below; do not use the same 
    example in your program.

    Kilograms to Pounds Conversion:
    To convert kilograms (kg) to pounds (lb), use the formula:

    Pounds (lb) = Kilograms (kg) * 2.20462

    Example: 5 kg * 2.20462 = 11.0231 lb
'''

c = 2.20462
kilo = 150
pound = kilo * c

print(f'{kilo} kilograms = {pound:.1f} pounds')
